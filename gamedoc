RailBound

This game is being developed for GameOff 2019.

The theme of this game is "LEAPS AND BOUNDS".
The player character will be able to jump across the play area simularly to a railgun. The player can use this ability to dodge and fight enemies. The player will also have an electromagnetic force field. It can only be activated for short periods, so timing will be crucial. If used to block an attack, the player will be knocked back depending on the power of the attack.
